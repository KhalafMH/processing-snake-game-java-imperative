# Snake Game Using Processing in Java Mode (Imperative Implementation)

This is a simple Snake game implementation that I have developed for a workshop that I conducted back in 2017.

To run the game:
  * Open Processing and set it to the Java mode. (Can be downloaded from here [https://processing.org/download/][1].
  * Copy the code from Snake.java and paste it in the Processing editor.
  * Click on Run.
  * Control the snake using the keyboard arrow keys.
